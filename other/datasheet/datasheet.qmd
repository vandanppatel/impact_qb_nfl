# Motivation

**Why was the dataset created?**
The dataset was created to analyze the relationship between quarterback (QB) performance and team success during the 2023 NFL season. This includes exploring metrics such as passing yards, touchdowns, interceptions, wins, and playoff qualifications. It aims to provide a comprehensive resource for understanding the impact of QBs on team outcomes while recognizing football as a team sport.

**Who created the dataset?**
The dataset was derived from the NFL's publicly available play-by-play data using the `nflfastR` package [@nflfastR]. Additional processing and aggregation were performed using R’s `tidyverse` [@tidyverse].

**Who funded the dataset creation?**
The dataset creation was part of an independent research initiative for academic purposes.

# Composition

**What does the dataset contain?**
The dataset includes:

- **Quarterback Metrics:**
  - Passing yards
  - Touchdowns
  - Interceptions
  - Average per-game performance metrics
- **Team Metrics:**
  - Total wins
  - Average score differential
  - Playoff qualification
**How was the data collected?**
The data was collected from publicly available NFL play-by-play data using tools like `nflfastR`. Advanced statistics and aggregation were performed using R packages, including `janitor` for data cleaning and `arrow` for efficient data storage.

**Does the dataset contain all possible data points?**
No, it excludes preseason and playoff data to focus on regular season performance.

**Are there known errors or gaps?**
Possible limitations include:
- Exclusion of contextual variables like weather or injuries.
- Potential inconsistencies in manually recorded NFL play-by-play data [@wirednfl].

# Use and Distribution

**How is the dataset distributed?**
The dataset is distributed in a Parquet format to ensure efficient storage and faster I/O operations.

**Who can use this dataset?**
The dataset is open to researchers, analysts, and students interested in exploring NFL analytics. Ethical use is encouraged to respect players’ privacy and the integrity of the sport.

**Are there licensing or usage restrictions?**
The dataset adheres to MIT licensing. Users must credit the source and ensure the data is used responsibly.

**What are potential ethical issues?**
While the dataset anonymizes individual player actions, ethical concerns arise when analyzing performance data. For instance, overemphasis on metrics like interceptions may lead to undue criticism of players [@pmcnfl].

# Methodology

**How was the data processed?**

1. **Cleaning and Standardization:** Using `janitor` to clean raw play-by-play data.
2. **Aggregation:** Summarizing QB and team-level metrics with filtering for starting QBs.
3. **Storage:** Saving processed data in Parquet format using the `arrow` package for reproducibility and efficiency.
**Were there any transformations?**
Yes, raw metrics like passing yards were aggregated at a season level, and team metrics such as wins and playoff qualification were computed from game results.

**What limitations exist in the methodology?**
The methodology does not account for external variables such as:
- Schedule difficulty
- Injuries
- Coaching strategies

# Maintenance

**Will the dataset be updated?**
No, this dataset focuses exclusively on the 2023 season. Future datasets may include subsequent seasons.

**Is there a point of contact?**
Yes, you can reach out to vandanp.patel@mail.utoronto.ca for further inquiries.

Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.

### Motivation
The dataset was created to analyze the impact of quarterback performance on team success in the 2023 NFL season, focusing on metrics such as wins, playoff qualification, and point differential.

The dataset was compiled from publicly available NFL play-by-play data using the `nflfastR` package [@nflfastR]. The authors aimed to explore the hypothesis that quarterbacks are the primary drivers of team success.

The dataset aims to answer the following questions:

* How do quarterback statistics correlate with team success metrics like wins and playoffs?
* Are turnovers (e.g., interceptions) more detrimental than touchdowns are beneficial?

### Composition
Dataset containts the following data:

* **Quarterback dataset**: Aggregated statistics such as passing yards, touchdowns, interceptions, and average metrics per game.
* **Team dataset**: Metrics including wins, points scored, points allowed, and playoff qualification.

No significant missing values were identified after cleaning. However, ties in games were excluded from win counts, and some metrics rely on aggregations that may introduce bias.

The following preprocessing was done:
* Data was filtered for the 2023 NFL regular season.
* Key metrics were aggregated for starting quarterbacks and teams.
* Playoff qualification was manually assigned based on publicly available postseason data.


### Use Cases
This dataset is intended for researchers, analysts, and sports enthusiasts interested in NFL statistics, player evaluation, and team performance analysis.

The intended uses of this dataset are:

* Statistical modeling of NFL team success.
* Exploratory data analysis for insights into quarterback contributions.
* Benchmarking for machine learning models.

### Collection Process
The dataset was sourced from the NFL's public play-by-play data, processed using the `nflfastR` package. Efforts were made to ensure transparency in data cleaning and processing. No personally identifiable information about players or staff was included.

### Limitation 
The limitations of the dataset are

* **Data granularity**: Only aggregated metrics were used; situational data (e.g., specific game contexts) was excluded.
* **External factors**: The dataset does not account for coaching decisions, injuries, or schedule difficulty.
* **Season scope**: Focused solely on the 2023 regular season, limiting longitudinal analysis.

Potential sources of bias are:

* Strong quarterbacks on weak teams may have skewed stats due to playing from behind.
* Playoff qualification was manually added, introducing potential human error.

### Ethics and Legal
The dataset reflects public data and does not include sensitive or personally identifiable information. However, its usage should avoid harm, such as misrepresentation of player performance. The dataset leverages publicly available data but adheres to NFL data-sharing policies.

### Future Directions
This dataset can potentially be improved by doing the following:

* Incorporating situational data, such as fourth-quarter performance or playoff-specific stats.
* Expanding the scope to include multiple seasons for longitudinal analysis.
* Adding advanced metrics from platforms like NFL Next Gen Stats to capture nuanced player performance.
